== Description ==

Blog retargeting will help you show your latest blog posts to your past visitors wherever they are on the Internet, return them back to your blog and convert them into subscribers.

What are the benefits of Blog Retargeting?

* Boost your newest posts
* Grow your subscriber base
* Turn one-time visitors into repeated readers
* Be top-of-mind among your readers

*While the plugin is free, the service is not. We charge only for the campaigns being run. You pay per clicks. The volume of clicks you get depends on the daily budget you set in the app.*

# Boost your newest posts

Give your newest posts a boost by retargeting them to your past visitors.

# Turn one-time visitors into repeated readers

Turn one-time visitors into repeated readers by constantly showing them your newest posts once they are published.

# Be top-of-mind among your readers

Grow thought leadership and stay top-of-mind among your readers by constantly delivering the newest content on the topics they have previously shown interest in.

# How does it work?

* A visitor comes to your blog, views a few blog posts, then leaves.
* Afterwards, wherever they go on the Internet, they will see your latest blog posts on the same topic they have previously shown interest in.
* The visitor clicks on your ad and returns to your blog. The more they see and click your ads and return to your blog, the more the likelihood they eventually subscribe.

# Where Will the Ads Be Displayed?

We cooperate with the largest third-party networks like Google DoubleClick AdExchange and OpenX, enabling us to access a large number of websites worldwide. This makes it possible for Rontar to reach out to as many of your blog's visitors as possible.
